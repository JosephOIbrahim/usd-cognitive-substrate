## Abstract

We present the USD Cognitive Substrate, a novel architecture that repurposes Universal Scene Description (USD) composition semantics—originally designed for conflict resolution in visual effects pipelines—for deterministic state management in large language model (LLM) applications.

The architecture achieves **fully deterministic cognitive behavior** from signal detection through response generation, with stochasticity isolated exclusively to irreducible human input/output boundaries.

**Key Innovation**: USD as Universal State Description.

## Key Contributions

### 1. LIVRPS Composition for Cognition

USD's composition semantics repurposed for AI state management:

| USD Concept | Cognitive Mapping |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Scene graph | Cognitive architecture |
| Prim attributes | Behavioral parameters |
| Composition arcs | Priority resolution |
| Variants | Mode switching |
| Layers | Cognitive subsystems |
| Payloads | Domain knowledge |

### 2. The Mycelium Mechanism

Bounded neuroplasticity with four rebalancing avenues:
- Activation spreading
- Hebbian learning (with proofs)
- Attractor dynamics
- Homeostatic regulation

All constrained by **hard safety floors** that can never be violated.

### 3. Formal Guarantees

**Theorem 1 (Safety Floor Invariant)**: For any update function U, safety floors are preserved.

**Theorem 2 (Bounded Learning)**: Weight updates are bounded by α × max(|o - e|) × max(||a||).

**Theorem 3 (Convergence)**: Under stationary outcome distribution, weights converge.

### 4. Determinism Contract

With ThinkingMachines batch-invariant kernels:

```
GIVEN: Identical input + state + timestamp + model + hardware
GUARANTEE: Identical output + state update + checksum
```

### 5. Falsifiability Criteria

The thesis would be **FALSIFIED** if:
1. LIVRPS produces paradoxes in >1% of configurations
2. Mycelium weights oscillate or degenerate
3. Safety floors can be violated
4. Determinism fails in >0.01% of cases with ThinkingMachines
5. A simpler system achieves equivalent accuracy
